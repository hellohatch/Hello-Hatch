# Leadership Risk Intelligence™ Platform Architecture

## Purpose

Leadership Risk Intelligence™ converts leadership behavior and leadership demand into measurable, time-series organizational risk signals.

The architecture operates across four measurement layers:

1. Behavioral Signal Layer
2. Leadership Demand Layer
3. Structural Exposure Layer
4. Predictive Risk Layer

---

## Layer 1 — Behavioral Signal Layer

### Leadership Signal Index™ (LSI)

This layer measures six leadership capability signals (scores `1..5`):

- Stress Regulation
- Cognitive Breadth
- Trust Climate
- Ethical Integrity
- Leadership Durability
- Adaptive Capacity

These signals represent the behavioral infrastructure of leadership stability under complexity.

### Domain definition — Stress Regulation

Stress Regulation measures a leader's ability to maintain cognitive clarity, emotional composure, and deliberate decision making when pressure increases.

Leadership roles often involve sustained exposure to uncertainty, competing priorities, and high consequence decisions. Leaders with strong stress regulation remain calm and deliberate even when facing escalating demands.

This signal reflects whether pressure is absorbed and processed effectively by the leader or whether stress begins to narrow decision thinking, accelerate reactions, or disrupt judgment.

Stress regulation is critical for leadership stability because unmanaged pressure can quickly propagate through teams and decision systems. When leaders regulate stress effectively, they stabilize the broader leadership environment and preserve decision quality under complexity.

### Behavioral output

Each leader produces six continuous variables stored over time:

- Stress Regulation Score
- Cognitive Breadth Score
- Trust Climate Score
- Ethical Integrity Score
- Leadership Durability Score
- Adaptive Capacity Score

Scoring standard for this domain:

- Stress Regulation Score = average of Q1–Q4

## Layer 2 — Leadership Demand Layer

### Leadership Load Index™ (LLI)

This layer measures interpretive demand on leadership across five dimensions (scores `1..5`):

- Decision Volume
- Interpretive Demand
- Strategic Complexity
- Leadership Span Pressure
- Cognitive Carryover

Leadership Load Score = average of the five dimension scores.

---

## Layer 3 — Structural Exposure Layer

### Concentration Exposure Index™ (CEI)

This layer detects decision dependency concentration using:

- Leadership Load Score
- Leadership Durability Score
- Cognitive Breadth Score

CEI stage categories:

- Healthy Distribution
- Exposure
- Concentration
- Structural Risk

---

## Layer 4 — Predictive Risk Layer

### Leadership Risk Score™ (`0..100`)

This layer combines behavioral stability, demand pressure, and structural exposure into unified risk output.

Core components:

1. Leadership Stability Score (weighted LSI average; durability weighted highest)
2. Leadership Stability Risk = `5 - Leadership Stability Score`
3. Leadership Load contribution
4. CEI stage modifier

Leadership Stability weighted component includes:

- `(Stress Regulation × 0.15)`

CEI stage modifiers:

- Healthy Distribution: `+0`
- Exposure: `+10`
- Concentration: `+20`
- Structural Risk: `+30`

### Leadership Cost Cascade™

Cascade stages mirror CEI classification:

- Healthy Distribution
- Exposure
- Concentration
- Structural Risk

---

## Time-series intelligence

The platform stores signals longitudinally to detect trend acceleration:

- Leadership Stability
- Leadership Load
- Durability compression rate
- Cognitive Breadth drift
- CEI stage movement

This enables transition from diagnostic intelligence to predictive intelligence.

## Platform outputs

### Diagnostic outputs

- Leadership Signal Index™ profile
- Leadership Load Index™ score
- Concentration Exposure Index™ stage
- Leadership Risk Score™
- Leadership Cost Cascade™ placement

### Organizational intelligence outputs

- Leadership risk dashboards
- Executive team exposure maps

---

## Category definition

Traditional leadership tools measure who a leader is.

Leadership Risk Intelligence™ measures how leadership capability interacts with organizational complexity and decision structure, enabling earlier detection of:

- Interpretive overload
- Leadership dependency
- Decision bottlenecks
- Durability compression
